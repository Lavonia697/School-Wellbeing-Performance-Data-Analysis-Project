# School Wellbeing & Performance Analysis Project

An end-to-end Python data analytics project exploring factors influencing learner performance and wellbeing.

---

## Project Overview
This project analyzes school performance using real-world educational and wellbeing indicators to understand how non-academic factors influences learner outcomes.

*Key indicators include:*
- Attendance rate
- Math score performance
- Household income
- Mental health indicators
- Extracurricular participation
- Parental involvement

The goal is to support NGOs, schools, and education-focused organizations with data-driven insights that inform early interventions and policy decisions.

---

## Analysis Workflow
1. Data ingestion and inspection
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing in Python
3. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
4. Visualization of key wellbeing-performance relationships
5. Insights generation and recommendations

---

1. ## Data Cleaning
   ### Key steps performed in Python:
   - Removal of duplicate records
   - Handling missing values using median and mode strategies
   - Standardization of column names and data types

  ---
## Documentation
A detailed explanation of the analytical approach and data preparation steps is available in the [Documentation](Documentation/methodology.md).

---

 2. ## Key Visualizations
*The following visual analyses were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn:*
  1. ### Attendance vs Math Score
     Demonstrates the positive relationship between consistent attendance and           academic performance.
     
  2. ### Correlation Heatmap
     Highlights variables with the strongest association to math scores.

  3. ### Income vs Mental Health Score
     Shows how socioeconomic conditions impact learner wellbeing.

  4. ### Math Score vs Parental Involvement
     Illustrates the influence of family engagement on academic outcomes.

  5. ### Mental Health vs Extracurricular Participation
     Explores how participation in extracurricular activities to mental wellbeing.

  3. ## Key Insights
  - Attendance is a strong predictor of academic performance, with learners above     85% attendance achieving higher average math scores.
  - Household income significantly influences mental health, with lower-income
  - learners reporting higher stress levels.
  - Mental wellbeing directly affects academic outcomes, reinforcing the need for     holistic learner support.
  - A high-risk learner group was identified based on:
      - Low attendance
      - Low household income
      - Poor mental health
      - Low academic performance
  * This group should be prioritized for targeted interventions.*

## Project Impact
*This analysis helps education-focused organizations:*
- Identify at-risk learners early
- Allocate resources more effectively
- Design targeted wellbeing interventions
- Advocate for data-backed education policies
