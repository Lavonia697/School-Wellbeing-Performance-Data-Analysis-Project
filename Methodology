#  Methodology

## 1. Project Objective

The objective of this analysis is to examine how learner wellbeing factors relate to academic performance, with a focus on identifying patterns that can inform early intervention strategies. The analysis is designed to support NGOs, schools, and education-focused stakeholders in understanding non-academic factors that influence learner outcomes.

## 2. Dataset Description

The dataset contains learner-level information capturing both academic performance and wellbeing indicators. Key variables include:

* Attendance rate
* Math score performance
* Household (guardian) income
* Mental health score
* Parental involvement level
* Extracurricular activity participation

The data represents a cross-sectional snapshot of learners and was treated as observational data.

## 3. Data Preparation and Cleaning

Data cleaning was performed using Python to ensure accuracy and reliability of the analysis. The following steps were applied:

* Removal of duplicate records to avoid double-counting learners
* Handling of missing values using median (for numerical variables) and mode (for categorical variables)
* Standardization of column names for consistency and readability
* Conversion of data types to appropriate numerical or categorical formats

These steps ensured the dataset was suitable for exploratory analysis and visualization.

## 4. Feature Engineering

Additional features were created to enhance analytical insights:

* **Performance Level**: Learners were categorized into low, medium, and high performance groups based on academic score thresholds
* **Socioeconomic Index**: A composite indicator derived from household income-related variables
* **Concern Flag**: A binary indicator used to identify learners potentially at risk, based on a combination of low attendance, low income, and poor mental health scores

These engineered features allowed for more targeted analysis of at-risk learner groups.

## 5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis was conducted to identify trends and relationships between wellbeing indicators and academic performance. Techniques included:

* Descriptive statistics to summarize distributions
* Grouped comparisons across performance and wellbeing categories
* Correlation analysis to assess the strength and direction of relationships between variables

Visualizations were created using Python libraries to support interpretation and communication of findings.

---

## 6. Visualization Approach

Charts and plots were used to explore key relationships, including:

* Attendance vs Math Score
* Household Income vs Mental Health
* Parental Involvement vs Academic Performance
* Extracurricular Participation vs Mental Health
* Correlation heatmap of wellbeing and performance indicators

Each visualization was accompanied by an interpretation to translate statistical patterns into practical insights for stakeholders.

---

## 7. Ethical Considerations

* The analysis focuses on aggregated patterns rather than individual learner identification
* No personally identifiable information (PII) was used or disclosed
* Findings are presented responsibly, avoiding causal claims where only correlation is observed

---

## 8. Limitations

* The dataset represents a snapshot in time and does not capture longitudinal changes
* Correlation analysis does not imply causation
* Some wellbeing measures may be influenced by unobserved or self-reported factors
* Results may not be generalizable beyond the dataset context

---

## 9. Conclusion

This methodology outlines a structured, ethical, and reproducible approach to analyzing the relationship between learner wellbeing and academic performance. The process emphasizes data quality, transparent analysis, and stakeholder-focused interpretation to support informed educational interventions.
